# Redirects
Some of our point to an external service, for example https://git.pythondiscord.com/ points towards our GitHub organisation.

This folder contains all the redirects for our subdomains.

They consist of an Ingress to handle the redirection through rewrrite annotations.

To deploy these routes simply run `kubectl apply -f .` in this folder.
